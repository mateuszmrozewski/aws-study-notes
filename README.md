# AWS Study Notes

This repository is a set of concise notes on various AWS services. I am creating
them while learning the services or analyzing them for work related tasks. Feel
free to use them for your learning, review and quick information access. 

**Disclaimer:** the notes might not be complete or up to date. You should always
verify specific information in the online AWS documentation. Especially details
of pricing and limits might change, as well as new feature might be added. 
Usually the FAQs are a good and quick place to start.
